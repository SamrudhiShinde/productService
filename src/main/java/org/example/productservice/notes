@RestController : This informs Spring that it has REST API's internally.This annotation will
basically register that particular class with Spring Dispatcher Servlet,so that whenever some request comes,
you can call those methods as there are some endpoints being executed in the controller class.

@GetMapping("/products/{productId}")
public String getSingleProduct(@PathVariable("productId") Long productId)
here the ("productId") is present in the path where the request is coming,read the variable
from the path and put the value of productId in this Long productId

@RequestMapping : This annotation is used to map requests to controller methods.This is used at
class level to express shared mappings or at the method level to narrow down to specific endpoint mapping.

What does a controller do?
Get the parameters from the request and pass those to the service.And service will return back to the client.
Ideally the service should be an interface,because today there coule be 1 way of implementing it
but tomorrow there could be some other way of implementing.

Controllers accept DTOs but services don't accept DTOs.
